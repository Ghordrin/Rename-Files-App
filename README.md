# Rename-Files-App
Renaming files via JavaFX

Beginner Java File Renamer with input validation and directory chooser. Currently only renames .txt files. will add a way to choose file type soon. 
Renames files to a specific name with adding leading zero's to each file ( 001,002,003,004,...)

It'll rename only the files with the extension selected in the app (default .txt). 

Use at own risk.
