# Rename-Files-App
Renaming files via JavaFX

Beginner Java File Renamer with input validation and directory chooser. Currently only renames .txt files. will add a way to choose file type soon. 

DISCLAIMER: it WILL rename ALL files in the chosen directory and change it to .txt. It won't check if the file is already a .txt, it will NOT check if there are other types but that in the directory.

Use at own RISK.
