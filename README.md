# Rename-Files-App
Renaming files via JavaFX

Beginner Java File Renamer with input validation and directory chooser.
Renames files to a specific name with adding leading zero's to each file ( 001,002,003,004,...). Possibly to change extension by using a drop down menu.

It'll rename only the files with the extension selected in the app (default .txt). 

Use at own risk.
